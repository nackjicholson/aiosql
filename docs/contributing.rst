Packaging & Distribution
------------------------

This aiosql repository uses the python standard packaging tools.
Read about them in more detail at the following links.

Development Setup
-----------------

1. Create a virtual environment

.. code:: sh

    git clone git@github.com:nackjicholson/aiosql.git
    cd aiosql
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip

All subsequent steps will assume you are using python within your activated virtual environment.

1. Install your environment to the dependencies defined in ``dev-requirements.txt``

Note: different versions of Python may install different versions of dependencies.
As `aiosql` is more or less expected to work with all these module versions, the
bare minimum version pinning is done in the requirements file.

.. code:: sh

    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

1. Run tests

.. code:: sh

    pytest

Alternatively, there is a `Makefile` to automate some of the above tasks:

.. code:: sh

    make venv.dev  # install dev virtualenv
    source venv/bin/activate
    make check  # run all checks: pytest, black, flake8, coverageâ€¦

Also, there is a working `poetry` setup in `pyproject.toml`.


Dependency Management
---------------------

There is no dependency for using ``aiosql``.

For development you need to test with various databases and even more drivers,
see above for generating a working python environment.
