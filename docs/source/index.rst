aiosql - Simple SQL in Python
==================================

SQL is code. Write it, version control it, comment it, and run it using files.
Writing your SQL code in Python programs as strings doesn't allow you to easily
reuse them in SQL GUIs or CLI tools like psql.
With aiosql you can organize your SQL statements in *.sql* files, load them
into your python application as methods to call without losing the ability to
use them as you would any other SQL file.

This project supports standard and `asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`__ based
drivers for
`SQLite <https://www.sqlite.org/>`__ (`sqlite3 <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html>`__, `aiosqlite <https://aiosqlite.omnilib.dev/en/latest/?badge=latest>`__, `apsw <https://pypi.org/project/apsw/>`__),
`PostgreSQL <https://postgresql.org/>`__ (`psycopg 2 and 3 <https://www.psycopg.org/docs/>`__, `pg8000 <https://pypi.org/project/pg8000/>`__, `pygresql <http://www.pygresql.org/>`__, `asyncpg <https://magicstack.github.io/asyncpg/current/>`__)
and `MySQL <https://www.mysql.com/>`__ (`PyMySQL <https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/>`__, `mysqlclient <https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/>`__, `mysql-connector <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/>`__) out of the box.

Extensions to support other database drivers can be written by you!

Installation
------------

.. code:: sh

    pip install aiosql


Usage
-----

Consider writing SQL in a file and executing it from methods in python,
for instance this *greetings.sql* file:

.. code:: sql

    -- name: get_all_greetings
    -- Get all the greetings in the database
    select greeting_id, greeting
      from greetings
     order by 1;

    -- name: get_user_by_username^
    -- Get a user from the database using a named parameter
    select user_id, username, name
      from users
     where username = :username;


This example has an imaginary SQLite database with greetings and users.
It prints greetings in various languages to the user and showcases the basic
feature of being able to load queries from a SQL file and call them by name
in python code.

You can use ``aiosql`` to load the queries in this file for use in your Python
application:

.. code:: python

    import aiosql
    import sqlite3

    queries = aiosql.from_path("greetings.sql", "sqlite3")

    with sqlite3.connect("greetings.db") as conn:
        user = queries.get_user_by_username(conn, username="willvaughn")
        # user: (1, "willvaughn", "William")

        for _, greeting in queries.get_all_greetings(conn):
            # scan [(1, "Hi"), (2, "Aloha"), (3, "Hola"), …]
            print(f"{greeting}, {user[2]}!")
        # Hi, William!
        # Aloha, William!
        # …


Or even in an asynchroneous way, with two SQL queries running in parallel
using ``aiosqlite`` and ``asyncio``:

.. code:: python

    import asyncio
    import aiosql
    import aiosqlite

    queries = aiosql.from_path("greetings.sql", "aiosqlite")

    async def main():
        async with aiosqlite.connect("greetings.db") as conn:
            # Parallel queries!
            greetings, user = await asyncio.gather(
                queries.get_all_greetings(conn),
                queries.get_user_by_username(conn, username="willvaughn")
            )

            for _, greeting in greetings:
                print(f"{greeting}, {user[2]}!")

    asyncio.run(main())


It may seem inconvenient to provide a connection on each call.
You may have a look at the `AnoDB <https://github.com/zx80/anodb>`__ `DB`
class which wraps both a database connection and query functions in one
connection-like extended object, including managing automatic reconnection if
needed.


Why you might want to use this
------------------------------

* You think SQL is pretty good, and writing SQL is an important part of your applications.
* You don't want to write your SQL in strings intermixed with your python code.
* You're not using an ORM like `SQLAlchemy <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`__ or
  `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__ ,
  with large (100k lines) code imprints vs under 800 for `aiosql`,
  and you don't need to.
* You want to be able to reuse your SQL in other contexts.
  Loading it into `psql` or other database tools.


Why you might NOT want to use this
----------------------------------

* You're looking for an `ORM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping>`__.
* You aren't comfortable writing SQL code.
* You don't have anything in your application that requires complicated SQL beyond basic CRUD operations.
* Dynamically loaded objects built at runtime really bother you.
